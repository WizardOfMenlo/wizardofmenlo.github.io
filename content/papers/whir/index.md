# WHIR üå™Ô∏è
We present WHIR (Weights Help Improving Rate), a concretely efficient IOPP for constrained Reed--Solomon codes[^1]. 

WHIR is both an IOPP for Reed--Solomon codes and a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PCS), and achieves the _fastest verification_ speed of *any* such scheme, even including univariate PCS with trusted setup. 
It does so while mantaining state-of-the-art argument size and verifier hash complexity for hash-based schemes, requiring only transparent setup and guaranteeing post-quantum security.

As a multilinear and univariate PCS, WHIR achieve by far the smallest verification time across all scheme that we tested.
Taking $d = 2^{24}$ as an example:
- At the 100-bit security level, a WHIR proof takes between 740Œºs (with $\rho = 1/2$) to 340Œºs (with $\rho = 1/16$). This is a speedup of between **5300√ó-10600√ó** against Brakedown, **1100√ó- 2200√ó** against Ligero, **150√ó-300√ó** against Hyrax, **12√ó-24√ó** against PST and **3.7√ó-7.3√ó** against KZG.
- At the 128-bit security level, a WHIR proof takes between 1.4ms to 700Œºs achieving a speedup of between **2600√ó-5300√ó** against Brakedown, **535√ó-1100√ó** against Ligero, **93√ó-186√ó** against Greyhound, **108√ó-216√ó** against Hyrax, **7√ó-14√ó** against PST and **2.6√ó-5.2√ó** against KZG.

As an hash-based multilinear PCS, WHIR compares favourably to BaseFold in (i) argument size (ii) verifier time (iii) verifier hashes.

Taking $d = 2^{24}$ and $\rho = 1/2$ as an example, at the 100-bit security level:
- WHIR's arguments are 101 KiB vs BaseFold's 7.95 MiB (**74√ó better**).
- WHIR's verifier runs in 740Œºs vs BaseFold's 24ms (**34√ó better**).

As a low-degree test, WHIR achieves best-in-class verifier time, while mantaining state-of-the-art argument size and verifier hash complexity.
Taking $d = 2^{24}$ and $\rho = 1/2$ as an example, at the 128-bit security level:
- WHIR's arguments occupy 157 KiB vs STIR's 160 KiB and FRI's 306 KiB (**1.95√ó better**).
- WHIR's verifier perform 2.8k hashes vs STIR's 2.6k and FRI's 5.6k (**2√ó better**).
- WHIR's verifier runs in 1.1ms vs STIR's 3.8ms and FRI's 3.9ms (**3.5√ó better**).

## Applications
We present a few applications that we believe WHIR is a natural candidate for.
### On chain verification
Currently, most onchain verification is done with Groth16 over a BN254 curve. The benefits of such verification is that the proof is constant size and verification is supposed to cheap, keeping both data availability (DA) costs and compute costs low. Currently, this verification costs [~280k gas](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x9db0680f9164e045cf1cbf6f6c3a1afff204e2dc6c5af9582fb2ba89ef3e2b12). 
We believe that, as long as DA costs are low (as they currently are), WHIR can offer significantly lower compute costs for onchain proof verification (and we are working on a Solidity verifier to confirm this thesis). 
A rough back-of-the-envelope calculation: a WHIR verifier for a polynomial of size $2^{24}$ performs between 2.2k to 1.1k hashes (depending on the initial rate, using 100-bits of security to compare with BN254). Assuming the hash used is Keccak, and that each of these hashes is for Merkle tree verification (and thus hashes together 64 bytes), each of these hashes costs 48 gas. Thus, the cost of hash-verification is between **106k gas to 53k gas**. Estimating the cost of the field operations is harder, but they tend account for a much smaller portion of the verification costs (on native experiments) compared to the hashing.

### Recursive verification
Due to the small number of hashes, WHIR's verifier (as STIR's was) is a natural candidate for recursion. Again, let's do some back-of-the-envelope calculation. At the 128-bit security level, for a computation of size $2^{28}$, starting with rate $1/2$, WHIR's recursive circuit performs $3.4$k hashes. Assuming both use Poseidon hashing and that each hash contributes ~400 R1CS constraints, the WHIR's recursive circuit size is approximately of size $2^{20}$. Then, running WHIR with even a large rate is a negligible cost (compared to the initial computation), leading to a tiny final proof. For example, running a computation of that size with rate $1/32$ gives a 64KiB proof in less than 3s (on my M1 Macbook), that verifies in less that $350¬µ$s while performing only 800 hashes.

### zkLogin
Various blockchains such as [Sui](https://sui.io/zklogin) and [Aptos](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides/aptos-keyless/how-keyless-works) have new onboarding and login strategy which make heavy use of zero-knowledge proofs. Currently, taking Sui's zkLogin as an example, the final circuit is around the size of a million of constraints and is currently proven by using a Groth16 proof system. WHIR could be used instead, reducing both proving time and verification time (which now is native!).
