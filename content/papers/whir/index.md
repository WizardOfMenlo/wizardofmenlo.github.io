This blog-post is a short introduction to our new work: "WHIR: Reed--Solomon Proximity Testing with Super-Fast Verification". This is joint work with [Gal Arnon,](https://galarnon42.github.io/) [Alessandro Chiesa,](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/) and [Eylon Yogev,](https://www.eylonyogev.com/about) and the full version is [available on ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/XXX).

# WHIR üå™Ô∏è
We present WHIR (Weights Help Improving Rate), a concretely efficient IOPP for constrained Reed--Solomon codes[^1]. 

WHIR is both an IOPP for Reed--Solomon codes and a multilinear polynomial commitment scheme (PCS), and achieves the _fastest verification_ speed of *any* such scheme, even including univariate PCS with trusted setup. 
It does so while mantaining state-of-the-art argument size and verifier hash complexity for hash-based schemes, requiring only transparent setup and guaranteeing post-quantum security.

As a multilinear and univariate PCS, WHIR achieve by far the smallest verification time across all scheme that we tested.
Taking $d = 2^{24}$ as an example:
- At the 100-bit security level, a WHIR proof takes between 740Œºs (with $\rho = 1/2$) to 340Œºs (with $\rho = 1/16$). This is a speedup of between **5300√ó-10600√ó** against Brakedown, **1100√ó- 2200√ó** against Ligero, **150√ó-300√ó** against Hyrax, **12√ó-24√ó** against PST and **3.7√ó-7.3√ó** against KZG.
- At the 128-bit security level, a WHIR proof takes between 1.4ms to 700Œºs achieving a speedup of between **2600√ó-5300√ó** against Brakedown, **535√ó-1100√ó** against Ligero, **93√ó-186√ó** against Greyhound, **108√ó-216√ó** against Hyrax, **7√ó-14√ó** against PST and **2.6√ó-5.2√ó** against KZG.

As an hash-based multilinear PCS, WHIR compares favourably to BaseFold in (i) argument size (ii) verifier time (iii) verifier hashes.

Taking $d = 2^{24}$ and $\rho = 1/2$ as an example, at the 100-bit security level:
- WHIR's arguments are 101 KiB vs BaseFold's 7.95 MiB (**74√ó better**).
- WHIR's verifier runs in 740Œºs vs BaseFold's 24ms (**34√ó better**).

As a low-degree test, WHIR achieves best-in-class verifier time, while mantaining state-of-the-art argument size and verifier hash complexity.
Taking $d = 2^{24}$ and $\rho = 1/2$ as an example, at the 128-bit security level:
- WHIR's arguments occupy 157 KiB vs STIR's 160 KiB and FRI's 306 KiB (**1.95√ó better**).
- WHIR's verifier perform 2.8k hashes vs STIR's 2.6k and FRI's 5.6k (**2√ó better**).
- WHIR's verifier runs in 1.1ms vs STIR's 3.8ms and FRI's 3.9ms (**3.5√ó better**).
