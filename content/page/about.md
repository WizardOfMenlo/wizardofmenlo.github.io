Hi! Welcome to this space. I am Giacomo, a PhD student at EPFL, where I am lucky enough to be supervised by [Alessandro Chiesa](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/).

My research interests are quite varied, spacing from (my main focus) interactive proof systems and their practical instantations to cryptanalysis of post quantum cryptographic primitives, methods for automatic discovery of bugs in cryptographic implementations and more.

You can find an up to date list of my publications [here](https://dblp.org/pid/350/5799.html), and a more sporadically updated one [here]({{< ref "/publications/publications.md" >}})
 .

Outside of this, I tend to be passionate about coffee, football, basketball, and obscure tidbits of italian history.
