Hi! Welcome to this space. I am Giacomo, a PhD student at EPFL, where I am lucky enough to be supervised by [Alessandro Chiesa](https://ic-people.epfl.ch/~achiesa/).

My research interests are quite varied, spacing from (my main focus) interactive proof systems and their practical instantations to cryptanalysis of post quantum cryptographic primitives, methods for automatic discovery of bugs in cryptographic implementations and more.

Outside of this, I tend to be passionate about coffee, football, basketball, and obscure tidbits of italian history.
