Hi! You have stumbled onto my blog, and it might be rude not to introduce myself. I am Giacomo, a MSc student of Cybersecurity at ETH Zurich.
I am interested in a variety of things, mostly about cryptography and formal security methods, but also fascinated by pure maths such as category 
theory, number theory and algebraic geometry. To be completely honest, I still have not decided what this blog will be about, I suspect it will be all 
over the place, so I hope you will enjoy the ride!

Giacomo
