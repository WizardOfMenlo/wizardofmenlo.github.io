# Preface
I seem to have picked up a number of nicknames over the years. Keeping track of them here not to forget (and for a laugh). Most of them have been given in a moment of _delirio di onnipotenza_, so tread with caution. 

## The Self-Referential List
- **Jack**
- **Wiz**
- **Fancy**
- **El Mas Grande**
- **Le Petit Roi**
- **Il Mecenate**
- **Il Grande Vecchio**
- **L'Andreotti della Crittografia**
- **Il Burattinaio**
- **Guacamole**
- **Pap√†**
- **Bauscia**
- **Taranto**
- **El Chico di Porta Venezia**

## Some quotes
