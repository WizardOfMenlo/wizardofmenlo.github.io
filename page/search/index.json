[{"content":"Exercises Hi! This is just a collection of write-ups of exercises that I found around and, for one reason or another, found quite cool. Spoiler warning, I guess?\nAlgebra: Chapter 0 Group Theory 3.1+3.2 Let us be in a category with products. Let $\\varphi: G \\to H$ be a morphism. We show that there is a unique morphism denoted as $\\varphi \\times \\varphi: G \\times G \\to H \\times H$ compatible with the natural projections. Then, consider $\\psi: H \\to K$. Show that: $$ (\\psi \\varphi) \\times (\\psi \\varphi) = (\\psi \\times \\psi)(\\varphi \\times \\varphi) $$\nThe proof is by abstract nonsense, which unfortunately my Latex Renderer does not support at the moment.\n3.4 Suppose that we have two groups $G, H$, such that $G \\cong G \\times H$ . Can we conclude that $H$ must be trivial?\nWhile the finite case seems to suggest this (since $|G| = |G||H|$ implies that $|H| = 1$) we can look at the infinite case for a simple counterexample. We consider $\\mathbb{Z}[x]$ as the ring of polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ that we consider as an additive ring. Consider the mapping: $$ \\mathbb{Z}[x] \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}[x] $$ $$ (p(x), c) \\mapsto x p(x) + c$$ First note that it is injective as if $x p(x) + c = x q(x) + d$ then it must be that $x (p(x) - q(x)) + c - d = 0$ and as such $p(x) = q(x)$ and $c = d$. It is also surjective, since given any polynomial we can write in the form $x p(x) + c$. Finally, it is a group homomorphism since: $$ (p(x) + q(x), c + d) \\mapsto x(p(x) + q(x)) + c + d = xp(x) + c + xq(x) + d $$ Therefore we have $\\mathbb{Z}[x] \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ but clearly $\\mathbb{Z}$ is non-trivial.\n3.5 Show that $\\mathbb{Q}$ is not the direct product of two non trivial groups.\nThis is an awesome question, and it can be answered in a really categorical manner. For completeness we will be proving all of the steps so this will probably include some stuff from previous exercises.\nWe proceed by contradiction, assume that $\\mathbb{Q} \\cong G \\times H$ for $G, H$ non trivial. We let $\\phi: \\mathbb{Q} \\xrightarrow{\\sim} G\\times H$ be the isomorphism.\nFirst, we notice that $G, H$ must be abelian. WLOG, suppose that $G$ were not, then there would be $f, g \\in G$ s.t. $f + g \\neq g + f$ . Then clearly $(f, 0) + (g, 0) \\neq (g, 0) + (f, 0)$. Then, we can find $q_1 = \\phi^{-1}(f, 0)$, $q_2 = \\phi^{-1}(g, 0)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}$ and since $\\phi$ is a bijections then $q_1 + q_2 \\neq q_2 + q_1$ which contradicts $\\mathbb{Q}$ being abelian. In fact this argument works for any abelian group and is non specific to $\\mathbb{Q}$\nNext, we show that in the category of abelian groups, products and coproducts agree. Letting $G \\times H$ be the direct product, we let $i_G: G \\to H$ be defined by mapping $g \\mapsto (g, 0)$ and similarly for $i_H$. Clearly these maps are group homomorphisms. We now show that $(G \\times H, i_G, i_H)$ is universal for the property of the coproduct. Let $(X, p_G: G \\to X, p_H: H \\to X)$ be another candidate. We then define a map $p_G \\oplus p_H : G \\times H \\to X$ by mapping $(g, h) \\mapsto p_G(g) + p_H(h)$. It is clear that $p_G = (p_G \\oplus p_H) i_G$ and $p_H = (p_G \\oplus p_H) i_H$ since $p_G, p_H$ must map 0 to 0 since they are group homomorphisms. It is also clear that $p_G \\oplus p_H$ is unique with this property, since any other map $f: G \\times H \\to X$ must also satisfy $p_G = f i_G, p_H = f i_H$ and so $f(g, 0) = p_G(g), f(0, h) = p_H(h)$ which then, implies by the homomorphism property that $f(g, h) = p_G(g) + p_H(h)$. So the only thing left to show is that $p_G \\oplus p_H$ is an abelian group homomorphism.\n$$ (p_G \\oplus p_H)(g + g', h + h') = p_G(g + g') + p_H(h + h') = p_G(g) + p_H(h) + p_G(g') + p_H(h')$$ $$ = (p_G \\oplus p_H)(g, h) + (p_G \\oplus p_H)(g', h') $$\nWhere we crucially use here the property that we are working with abelian groups to reorder the sum.\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ has a very interesting property, namely that any two non trivial subgroups have a non trivial intersection. $A, B \\leq \\mathbb{Q}$. Let $\\frac{m}{n} \\in A$ be non-zero. Then $n \\times \\frac{m}{n} = m \\in A$ and as such we have that $m\\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq A$. Similary we can find a $m'$ such that $m'\\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq B$. But then clearly $\\mathrm{lcm}(m, m')\\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq A \\cap B$ and as such the intersection is non trivial.\nNext, note that the injections that we defined are actually injective functions, and as such monomorphisms in the category. (The direction injective $\\implies$ mono follows from Set, while the other can be seen considering morphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}$ ). As such, the injection $i_G, i_H$ can be composed with the isomorphism $\\phi$ which results in an injection of $G, H$ into $\\mathbb{Q}$. Denoting by $\\widetilde{G}, \\widetilde{H}$ the images of $G, H$ under such injections, we see that $\\widetilde{G}, \\widetilde{H}$ will be non trivial subgroups of $\\mathbb{Q}$ and as such must have a non trivial intersection. However, $i_G(G) \\cap i_H(H)$ is trivial in $G \\times H$, and as such must be carried to the trivial subgroup in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a contradiction.\n","date":"2021-07-30T01:01:55+02:00","permalink":"https://wizardofmenlo.github.io/math/exercises/","title":"Exercises"}]
