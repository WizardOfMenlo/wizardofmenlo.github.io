We extend the vector commitment scheme of [WW23]1 with an evaluation proof, and achieve a lattice-based polynomial commitment scheme with polylogarithmic proof size and verifier complexity. We further investigate the applicability of our techniques to the Polynomial IOP of [Marlin]2, show that our scheme is easily batchable and more!
Polynomial Commitments A polynomial commitment scheme is a natural generalization of a vector commitment scheme, in which a party is able to commit to a polynomial $f$, and later engage in a evaluation protocol to show that $f(u) = z$.</description></item></channel></rss>
